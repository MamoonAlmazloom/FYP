## Create .gitkeep files

To keep empty directories in git, create these `.gitkeep` files:

**Backend/uploads/.gitkeep**
```
# This file ensures the uploads directory is tracked by git
```

**Backend/logs/.gitkeep**
```
# This file ensures the logs directory is tracked by git
```

**Backend/temp/.gitkeep**
```
# This file ensures the temp directory is tracked by git
